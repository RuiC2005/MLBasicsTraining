# MLBasicsTraining

This is a simple image classification project built with Python and TensorFlow. It uses a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The goal of this project is to learn the fundamentals of machine learning, including training, evaluation, and prediction.

Features

- Neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras
- Trained on the MNIST dataset (70,000 images of handwritten digits)
- Evaluates model accuracy
- Makes predictions on test images

Technologies

- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**  
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-image-classifier.git
   cd ai-image-classifier
   

2. **Install dependencies**  
   It's recommended to use a virtual environment.  
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

3. **Run the training script**  
   bash
   python train.py
  

4. **Run predictions (optional)**  
   bash
   python predict.py
   

Sample Output

The model achieves over 95% accuracy on the test set after training. You can test it on your own input images or view predictions from the test data.

Learning Goals

This project was created to:

- Understand how image data is processed for ML
- Learn how to build and train a basic neural network
- Explore evaluation metrics like accuracy
